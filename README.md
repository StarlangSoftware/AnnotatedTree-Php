# Constituency TreeBank

A treebank is a corpus where the sentences in each language are syntactically (if necessary morphologically) annotated. In the treebanks, the syntactic annotation usually follows constituent and/or dependency structure.

Treebanks annotated for the syntactic or semantic structures of the sentences are essential for developing state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing (NLP) systems including part-of-speech-taggers, syntactic parsers, and machine translation systems. There are two main groups of syntactic treebanks, namely treebanks annotated for constituency (phrase structure) and the ones that are annotated for dependency structure.

## Data Format

We extend the original format with the relevant information, given between curly braces. For example, the word 'problem' in a sentence in the standard Penn Treebank notation, may be represented in the data format provided below:

	(NN problem)

After all levels of processing are finished, the data structure stored for the same word has the following form in the system.

	(NN {turkish=sorunu} {english=problem} 
	{morphologicalAnalysis=sorun+NOUN+A3SG+PNON+ACC}
	{metaMorphemes=sorun+yH}
	{semantics=TUR10-0703650})

As is self-explanatory, 'turkish' tag shows the original Turkish word; 'morphologicalanalysis' tag shows the correct morphological parse of that word; 'semantics' tag shows the ID of the correct sense of that word; 'namedEntity' tag shows the named entity tag of that word; 'propbank' tag shows the semantic role of that word for the verb synset id (frame id in the frame file) which is also given in that tag.

For Contibutors
============

### composer.json file

1. autoload is important when this package will be imported.
```
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "olcaytaner\\WordNet\\": "src/"
    }
  },
```
2. Dependencies should be maximum (not only direct but also indirect references should also be given), everything directly in the code should be given here.
```
  "require-dev": {
    "phpunit/phpunit": "11.4.0",
    "olcaytaner/dictionary": "1.0.0",
    "olcaytaner/xmlparser": "1.0.1",
    "olcaytaner/morphologicalanalysis": "1.0.0"
  }
```

### Data files
1. Add data files to the project folder. Subprojects should include all data files of the parent projects.

### Php files

1. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    /**
     * Returns true if specified semantic relation type presents in the relations list.
     *
     * @param SemanticRelationType $relationType element whose presence in the list is to be tested
     * @return bool true if specified semantic relation type presents in the relations list
     */
    public function containsRelationType(SemanticRelationType $relationType): bool{
        foreach ($this->relations as $relation){
            if ($relation instanceof SematicRelation && $relation->getRelationType() == $relationType){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
2. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    public function getRelation(int $index): Relation{
```
3. Write getter and setter methods.
```
    public function getOrigin(): ?string
    public function setName(string $name): void
```
4. Use standard javascript test style by extending the TestCase class. Use setup when necessary.
```
class WordNetTest extends TestCase
{
    private WordNet $turkish;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        ini_set('memory_limit', '450M');
        $this->turkish = new WordNet();
    }

    public function testSize()
    {
        $this->assertEquals(78327, $this->turkish->size());
    }
```
5. Enumerated types should be declared with enum.
```
enum CategoryType
{
    case MATHEMATICS;
    case SPORT;
    case MUSIC;
    case SLANG;
    case BOTANIC;
```
6. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
    public function constructor1(string $path, string $fileName): void
    public function constructor2(string $path, string $extension, int $index): void
    public function __construct(string $path, string $extension, ?int $index = null)
```
7. Use __toString method if necessary to create strings from objects.
```
    public function __toString(): string
```
8. Use xmlparser package for parsing xml files.
```
  $doc = new XmlDocument("../test.xml");
  $doc->parse();
  $root = $doc->getFirstChild();
  $firstChild = $root->getFirstChild();
```
